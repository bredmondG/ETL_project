# ETL_project

This project collected baseball stas about the Colorado Rockies from the MLB API. It used the player_id tag to collect information on all players that have played for the Rockies.

After pulling the data into a csv using API requests, it is uploaded into PostGres, cleaned, standardized, and tested using several queries.
